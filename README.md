# five-questions-quiz
It's a very basic website that checks how many, of the 5 questions you get right and wrong :3

Mind the fact that everytime you get an answer wrong, it deducts your score by 1, this is to prevent manipulative multiple attempts since 
you could get an answer wrong and continue to try and get the answer correct without the score being impacted which can be unfair

It's very basic so let me know what else I could add into this thing.
